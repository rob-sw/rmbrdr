Remove white border from photos

A small script that removes the white lines on all four edges of photos that have been scanned.

Usage:
* Check the configuration section and fill-in the directories where the photos are and where the results should be stored. Beware, existing files in the target directory might be overwritten.
* If necessary, tweak the other configuration settings. Start with the defaults.
* Run the script.
